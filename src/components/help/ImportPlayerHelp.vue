      The Player Import page will allow you to import a player. You can either
      copy paste the player detail from your squad page in Battrick and click on
      "Extract Player Details" or you can populate the fields below manually.
      The player details will be populated below and should be verified by the
      Manager. If you are happy with the player details, you can save the player
      by clicking on "Import Player".
